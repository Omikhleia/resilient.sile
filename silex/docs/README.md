# SILE extensions for _re·sil·ient_

This folder contains the SILE extensions for the _re·sil·ient_ collection of packages and classes.

They consist of experimental rewrite of the base typesetter (_sile·nt_), page builder (_page·ant_) and other SILE core components.

## (Caution 1) Breaking changes

When enabled, the components replace those from SILE.
They are a departure from the original SILE code, and are not compatible with all legacy SILE packages.

So be aware that enabling them may break your existing SILE legacy documents, and be conscious of the consequences when you decide to opt-in for these components outside of the _re·sil·ient_ collection.

## (Caution 2) Experimental

This is a work in progress, not yet ready for production use.

SILE **0.15.10** is required for now, and there's no guarantee that it will work with earlier versions, nor with later ones.

(The supported version may change without notice in the future, as the code is still being developed.)

##  (Caution 3) License terms

All code is this folder is licensed under the **GNU General Public License v3.0**, (c) 2025 Omikhleia / Didier Willis.

This is therefore a different license from SILE itself (and earlier versions of the _re·sil·ient_ collection), licensed under the MIT license.
