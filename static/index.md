At some point, we may set up a proper documentation site, with some architecture and design notes.

For now, if you are a developer, you can browse the [generated documentation](api/) from the source code.
Most, if not all, of the re路sil路ient modules have been annotated with LDoc comments, for you to browse and understand the internals.

Feel free to contribute to this effort, and help up make re路sil路ient better, easier to maintain, and easier to extend.
