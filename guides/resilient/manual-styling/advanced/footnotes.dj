## Styling footnotes

When styling footnotes, two things are at stakes:

 - How footnote references in the main text flow are formatted.
 - How footnote content is formatted.

### Footnote references

There are two different cases: numbered footnotes, and footnotes marked
with a symbol (such as a dagger â€ ).
Just in case it _could_ be useful to distinguish them, we have distinct
main style definitions here.
The default definitions, though, just inherit from the same common
parent style.

```yaml
footnote-reference-counter:
  inherit: "footnote-reference"
footnote-reference-symbol:
  inherit: "footnote-reference"
```

Let us agree with Robert Bringhurst: "In the main text, superscript numbers are
used to indicate notes because superscript numbers minimize interruption."
He doesn't mention symbol marks, but we can assume the rationale also applies
to them.

```yaml
footnote-reference:
  style:
    properties:
      position: "super"
```

_However_, regarding French typography, Jean-Pierre Lacroux reminds us:
"Whatever its form, the footnote reference must be placed before the punctuation,
and preceded by a thin unbreakable space." (Lacroux does not say what this
thin space actually is, compared to other "thin" spaces used in French.)
The first point is up to the composer, but the second point would call for a
slightly different style definition, such as the following one.

```yaml
footnote-reference:
  style:
    properties:
      position: "super"
    numbering:
      before:
        kern: "1thsp"
```

### Footnote content

Jean-Pierre Lacroux: "Notes are typeset in a smaller size than the current text
(ratio: about 2/3)." This is followed by a list of "usual" fixed sizes depending
on the main font size. Call that ageing, but this author doesn't like reading so
small notes, so opted to something less drastic by default. In the digital age,
moreover, we can get rid of fixed-size mappings, which where due to the metal
fonts of the past being only available in a limited number of sizes.

```yaml
footnote:
  style:
    font:
      size: "0.8em"
    numbering:
      display: "arabic"
```

By the way, note that this style is also where the number format is
specified.[^footnote-styles-numbering]

[^footnote-styles-numbering]: The other "numbering" styling elements have
no effect here; conversely a "display" element in other footnote styles
is simply ignored. The reason, obviously, is that having a different
number format on footnote references and markers would have no sense.

Regarding the footnote marker in the body of the footnote content,
as stated above, we can distinguish numbered footnotes, and footnotes
with a symbol. But let's focus on their common parent style first.

Robert Bringhurst: "The number in the note should be full size."
So normally, one does not use a superscript here.
Bringhurst is less opinionated, it seems, on how the footnote text should
be presented. Jan Tschichold lists several rules according to his own
taste, but this author has seldom seen them used in actual books.

A good compromise is to indent all the text by some amount, and place
the footnote mark left-aligned in the available space. To achieve this,
we use the special negative "before kern" specification.

```yaml
footnote-marker:
  style:
    numbering:
      after:
        kern: "iwsp"
      before:
        kern: "-3.75nspc"
```

Note that the implementation is clever enough: if the footnote mark cannot
be contained in that space (minus an extra figure width, so as to be safer
and account for a punctuation etc.), then the "after kern" value is
inserted, so that the text of the footnote flows naturally.

Robert Bringhurst then declares: "Punctuation, apart from empty space, is not
normally needed between the number and text of the note."
But then, he shows an example with a period...
Jan Tschichold does mention using a "normal numeral followed by a period",
but he is also very opinionated on other topics such as text indents.
Anyhow, this author recognizes too that a period is regularly seen in many
books. Let's go for it in our default style.

```yaml
footnote-marker-counter:
  inherit: "footnote-marker"
  style:
    numbering:
      after: "."
```

For symbol markers, one can admit that a punctuation is not needed, indeed,
between the mark and the text of the note.

```yaml
footnote-marker-symbol:
  inherit: "footnote-marker"
```

Would you _really_ want it, here is a possible style with superscript markers,
and the number followed by a non-breaking figure space. In that case,
we do not want a period after the number.

```yaml
footnote-marker:
  style:
    numbering:
      after:
        kern: "1nspc"
footnote-marker-counter:
  inherit: "footnote-marker"
  style:
    properties:
      position: "super"
```

The spacing here is inserted _after_ the footnote marker, without the
footnote text being otherwise indented.
This author has no definitive idea whether symbol markers also ought to be
typeset as superscripts too, so this example doesn't do it. Would you
want it, it should be quite straightforward how to achieve it.
