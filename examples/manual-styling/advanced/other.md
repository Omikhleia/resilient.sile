## Other styling considerations

The previous sections describe several usual cases, but cannot be exhaustive.
In brief, all resilient-compatible packages may provide their own styles.
You should therefore read their documentation to learn about them, and look at a newly generated style file to check how they are defined by default.

Readers experienced with SILEâ€™s standard packages also have to be aware that the latter sometimes define hooks, initially intended for users to possibly re-implement in order to override some internal formatting logic. Obviously, in the context of a resilient-compatible class, some of these are already overriden to rely on the styling paradigm presented here.

For instance, the (standard) **url** package provides a `urlstyle` hook command. While you could override it---that is, redefine that command---, please note that this is what the resilient classes already do, so as to delegate the decision to a style conveniently called `urlstyle` too.[^other-sile-hooks]

[^other-sile-hooks]: The same principle actually applies to page numbers, relying on the standard **folio** package. The latter provides a `foliostyle` hook, which the resilient styling system overrides with its own clever logic.

In other terms, even for standard SILE packages, we may already have provided a style-aware version of their original customization hooks.
