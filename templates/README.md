# Templates

This folder contains default templates notably used for "book matters" (cover pages, title and half-title pages, endpapers, etc.).

All these templates are licensed under **CC0 Universal / Public Domain**.

As explained in the User Guide, authors are totally free to use their own templates, and can override the default ones by providing their own templates and use them in their works (e.g. usually in their master documents).

This being said, the default templates can be used as they are.

Obviously, it should go without saying, but using the default templates does not require any special mention in your documents, and does not affect the license of your documents in any way.

Note that the default "endpaper" verso template includes a small mention "This book is typeset with the SILE typesetting system and the _re路sil路ient_ collection of classes & packages." This is **not** a requirement for any work produced using this collection, and you are entirely free not to have such a mention in your own templates and generated documents. While credit is always appreciated, as far as we are concerned, we do not require it, neither for SILE nor for the _re路sil路ient_ collection.
